# TASKQUEST: Solitaire Task RPG

**TaskQuest** is a productivity application that gamifies task management by treating your to-do list as a dungeon crawler board game.

## The Core Loop: "Solitaire RPG"

This app is designed around a unique "Solitaire" concept where you play two roles: the **Game Master (GM)** and the **Player**.

### 1. GM Mode (The Planning Phase)
*   **Role:** Architect, Strategist.
*   **Goal:** Design the "Dungeon" of tasks.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Break down large goals into smaller node networks using the "Breakdown" tool.
    *   Connect tasks logically to create paths.
    *   Use GenAI to generate campaigns or suggestions.
    *   **Save Campaign:** Save your constructed task network as a "Scenario".

### 2. Player Mode (The Execution Phase)
*   **Role:** Adventurer.
*   **Goal:** Conquer the dungeon by completing tasks.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Move your pawn node-by-node.
    *   Complete tasks to earn XP and level up.
    *   "Scout" adjacent areas (GenAI) if you get stuck or need new tasks dynamically.
    *   **Save Progress:** Save your current character stats (XP, Level) and position.

By switching between these modes, you plan your day/project objectively (GM), then immerse yourself in execution (Player), turning mundane work into a quest for progress.
